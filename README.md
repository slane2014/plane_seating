# Plane Seating
#### by Scott Lane, 2/26/16

This set of documents contains a solution to the Plane Seating puzzle that was posted on FiveThirtyEight.com.

There’s an airplane with 100 seats, and there are 100 ticketed passengers each with an assigned 
seat. They line up to board in some random order. However, the first person to board is the 
worst person alive, and just sits in a random seat, without even looking at his boarding pass. 
Each subsequent passenger sits in his or her own assigned seat if it’s empty, but sits in a 
random open seat if the assigned seat is occupied. What is the probability that you, the hundredth passenger to board, finds your seat unoccupied?
